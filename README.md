## Singleton Pattern in Dart

## Overview

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful for managing shared resources such as database connections.

## Implementation Details

This project demonstrates the Singleton pattern in Dart using a Database class. The Database class ensures that only one instance of the database is created and shared across the application.

## Features

Ensures a single instance of the Database class.

Provides a getInstance() method to retrieve the same instance.

Includes a connect() method to simulate database connection.

Includes a Client class to test the Singleton behavior.

Benefits of Singleton Pattern

Prevents multiple object creation, saving memory.

Ensures controlled access to shared resources.

Provides a single point of access to the instance.

## Usage Scenarios

Database connections

Logging frameworks

Configuration settings

Caching mechanisms

## How to Run

Clone this repository.

Open the project in a Dart-supported IDE (e.g., VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA).

Run the main.dart file using:

```
dart run
```

Observe the output to confirm Singleton behavior.
